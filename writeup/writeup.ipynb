    "Getting a basic Arduino [terminal monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) is straigtforward, if building upon a graphics library that supports text rendering. Bodmer [has a nice demo for the Arduino using the Adagruit GFX graphics libraries](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_ILI9341/blob/master/examples/TFT_Terminal/TFT_Terminal.ino), and Philippe Lucidarme has [a short-and-sweet demo for the Seeduino](https://lucidar.me/en/arduino/arduino-terminal-on-tft-display/) [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJgGYW88EpY).

    "However, getting good performance with the Arduino is hard. Scrolling requires re-drawing large areas, and is slow. One work-around is to use the ILI9341's built-in vertical scrolling feature. Among the most feature-complete is [Nick Matantsev's TinTTY VT100 emulator for Arduino+ILI9341](https://github.com/unframework/tintty). This includes fast vertical scrolling and a touchscreen keyboard. Nick cites as inspiration this [VT100 emulator for the ILI9340 screen with Arduino](https://github.com/mkschreder/avr-vt100), by Martin K. SchrÃ¶der. Bodmer's [vertical-scrolling terminal for Arduino+ILI9341](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-serial-UART-scrolling-display-terminal-usi/) notes that performance can be improved further by optimizing the graphics drivers to write directly to the 8-bit PORTB/C/D registers on the Arduino Uno.\n",

    "# Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Unicode***: Codepoints are decoding from incoming UTF-8 serial data. These are sent to a routine that finds the corresponding unicode block for eah code point. The first 128 code-points \"Basic Latin\" are mapped to ASCII. Otherwise, a custom subroutine for the given block is called to handle rendering. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Fonts***: We provide a texture containing 512 basic glyphs, each 5 pixels wide and 11 pixels tall. Glyph indecies corresponding to 128-bit ASCII are kept the same. Other indecies are filled with various glyphs in no particular order. These are \"base glyphs\" that may be futher modified / transformed to render a particular unicode code point. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Soft fonts***: The unicode blocks \"Box Drawing\", \"Block Drawing\" and \"Legacy Computing Characters\" are handled as a \"soft font\". These are implemented as custom subroutines that draw each character, rather than bitmapped fonts (although some do use bitmap data to help with drawing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Font mapping***: There are *way* too many characters in unicode. However, most of these consist of pre-composed variants of Latin characters, with various modifications. Many characters are identical across different alphabets. Others can be drawn as e.g. reflected versions of basic latin characters. For alphabetic blocks beyons \"basic latin\", we associate each unicode point with (1) a \"base glyph\" index and (2) a number indicating a transformation/modification to be performed, if any. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Colors***: We use a state-machine to parse ANSI CSI escape codes for color. 8-bit RRRBBGGG foreground/background colors are stored in the global state registers `fg` and `bg`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Blink***: We support a single blink speed (ANSI \"fast blink\" and \"slow blin\" are treated the same). Blink is implemented by retaining two bit vectors, one which tracks whether a given row/column should be blinking, and another that tracks whether it is currently highlighted. While the arduino is not receiving serial data, it runs a background loop to toggle the highlight on blinking locations. Highlight is implemented using fast xor-paint. This allows the same drawing code to set/unset the highligt. Both the \"blink\" and \"highlight\" bit-vectors are scrolled when the screen scrolls. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Italic, Bold, Blackletter, and combinations thereof***: There isn't enough room to store separate fonts, so we implement these in software as transformations. \"Italic\" applies a slant by shifting the bottom half of the character left one pixel. \"Bold\" applies a bit-convolution to thicken the lines (while avoiding merging vertical strokes). Blackletter is replaced with a \"very bold\" effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Box drawing unicode block***: These characters are rendered by combinding basic subcomponents. For example, a bold box-drawing character is rendered by stamping a thin-line box-drawing character over top of a double-line box drawing character. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Combining diacritics***: These are, frankly, a nightmare. But, an attempt has been made to implement them. No further comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Scrolling***: I like the horizontal display, but there is no way to scroll it quickly on the ILI9341. To work around this, the \"scroll\" routine scrolls 8 lines at a time. "

    "- What raw I/O operations is the driver actually doing? Are they all necessary? Check out the ILI9341 and AtMega328 datasheets. Expand all macros until you can see the raw writes to the Arduino's 8-bit IO ports. On the Arduino Uno, these are PORTB, PORTC, and PORTD. \n",

    "- See if some common special cases can be handled quicker using an optimized sequence of commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "- For the Uno, The ILI9341 shield uses PORTB and PORTD to send data, and PORTC to control the serial clock.\n",
    "- The ILI9341 shield uses an 8-bit parallel interface. Color data is 16-bit. Every pixel sent requires writing the high then low byte. The values of PORTB and PORTD must be changed twice to send a single pixel. This is expensive. \n",
    "- Instead, send only colors for which the HIGH and LOW bytes are *the same*. This allows you to set PORTB and PORTD once, then clock PORTC rapidly to fill in pixel data with a single color. Restricting to colors with the same HIGH and LOW bytes gives a 256 color pallet, with color channels packed as RRRBBGGG.\n",
    "- The interface requires changing bits on both PORTB and PORTD. If you're not using any other pins on these ports, it's OK to write to all pins on both ports. Although the serial line is technically using bits 0 and 1 of PORTD, these bits will be ignore as long as the USART serial interface is enabled. To prepare to send a 256-color byte `b`, one can simply write `PORTB=PORTD=b;` (assuming all pins are set to output mode, of course). This is by far fastest way to get color data from the Arduino onto the ILI9341.\n"
